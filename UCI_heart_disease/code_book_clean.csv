#ST segment is a specific part of the ECG between two heartbeats
#The most important cause of ST segment abnormality (elevation or depression) is myocardial ischaemia or infarction
#angina is a heart condition (cardiopathy);a heart condition marked by paroxysms of chest pain due to reduced oxygen to the heart
#Thalassemia are inherited blood disorders characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production
