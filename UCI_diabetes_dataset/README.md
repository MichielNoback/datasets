## Diabetes data

This dataset is hosted on the UCI machine earning website, and copied here for convenience.

### Description

The DIABETES data sets in this directory are provided for use in 1994 
AI in Medicine symposium submissions.  Permission is granted to use the
data sets for other research purposes as long as appropriate credit is
given as to the source (AIM-94 data set provided by Michael Kahn, MD, PhD, 
Washington University, St. Louis, MO).


### Provided files

* Domain-Description: This file describes the basic physiology and patho-
physiology of diabetes mellitus and its treatment.  
* data-[01-70]: data sets covering several weeks' to months' worth of
outpatient care on 70 patients.  An additional 10 sets will be made
available two weeks prior to the symposium for interested parties.  Please
contact the organizers if you would like to obtain these data sets.
**Only the first 10 data files are represented here**. For all files, refer

### Data Set Information

Diabetes patient records were obtained from two sources: an automatic electronic recording device and paper records. The automatic device had an internal clock to timestamp events, whereas the paper records only provided "logical time" slots (breakfast, lunch, dinner, bedtime). For paper records, fixed times were assigned to breakfast (08:00), lunch (12:00), dinner (18:00), and bedtime (22:00). Thus paper records have fictitious uniform recording times whereas electronic records have more realistic time stamps.

### Attribute Information

Diabetes files consist of four fields per record. Each field is separated by a tab and each record is separated by a newline.

File Names and format:
(1) Date in MM-DD-YYYY format
(2) Time in XX:YY format
(3) Code
(4) Value

The Code field is deciphered as follows:

    33 = Regular insulin dose
    34 = NPH insulin dose
    35 = UltraLente insulin dose
    48 = Unspecified blood glucose measurement
    57 = Unspecified blood glucose measurement
    58 = Pre-breakfast blood glucose measurement
    59 = Post-breakfast blood glucose measurement
    60 = Pre-lunch blood glucose measurement
    61 = Post-lunch blood glucose measurement
    62 = Pre-supper blood glucose measurement
    63 = Post-supper blood glucose measurement
    64 = Pre-snack blood glucose measurement
    65 = Hypoglycemic symptoms
    66 = Typical meal ingestion
    67 = More-than-usual meal ingestion
    68 = Less-than-usual meal ingestion
    69 = Typical exercise activity
    70 = More-than-usual exercise activity
    71 = Less-than-usual exercise activity
    72 = Unspecified special event
