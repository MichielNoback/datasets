# Pigs data  
Growth curves of pigs in a 3x3 factorial experiment

## Description  
The dietox data frame has 861 rows and 7 columns.

## Columns
This data frame contains the following columns:

Weight - Weight in Kg

Feed - Cumulated feed intake in Kg

Time - Time (in weeks) in the experiment

Pig - Factor; id of each pig

Evit - Factor; vitamin E dose; see 'details'.

Cu - Factor, copper dose; see 'details'

Start - Start weight in experiment, i.e. weight at week 1.

Litter - Factor, id of litter of each pig

## Details  
Data contains weight of slaughter pigs measured weekly for 12 weeks. Data also contains the startweight (i.e. the weight at week 1). The treatments are 3 different levels of Evit = vitamin E (dose: 0, 100, 200 mg dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetat /kg feed) in combination with 3 different levels of Cu=copper (dose: 0, 35, 175 mg/kg feed) in the feed. The cumulated feed intake is also recorded. The pigs are littermates.
