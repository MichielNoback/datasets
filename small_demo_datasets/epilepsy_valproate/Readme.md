# Valproate treatment for epilepsy

## Background

Epileptic patients were treated with valproate or a placebo.
During an 8-week period, the number of epileptic seizures were counted for each patient.

After this, the patients were "crossed over" to the other treatment. Again the number of seizures was counted over an 8-week period.
